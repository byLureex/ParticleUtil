1. Create a class with the name PsrticleUtil.java.
2. Then copy the code in the class and replace all the imports.
3. Go into your class you want to get the particles into and write in there private ParticleUtil particles; and then call it with: this.particles = new ParticleUtil(this.width, this.height);
